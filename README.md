Due to licensing restrictions, the original dataset containing the full 800,000 tweets cannot be distributed online.

However, in this repository, we include the full set of manually-coded training and test data, as well as Python code for transforming data and training and validating the model, as well as R code for producing summary statistics, tables, and graphs. This code permits the training of an identical model and replication of our reported statistics and metrics.

We also include the coding instructions that were disseminated to coders tasked with manually classifying net-neutrality related tweets.
